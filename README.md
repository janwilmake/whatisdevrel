# What is DevRel?

This is a website that explains what developer relations is, how to get a job doing it, and tips for beginning and aspiring devrels.

This was forked and reverse-engineered from https://github.com/Nutlope/whatisdevrel to show that its much cleaner to actually use markdown as source. The HTML file was fully generated by AI.

Where the original code was 8.4k tokens, and the content spread over 38 files, this source is just 2200 tokens over 3 files, the HTML being a generated artifact. It's not perfect, but greatly simplifies the source, making editing it much more approachable.

Deployment:
`flaredream deploy`
