# What is DevRel?

This is a website that explains what developer relations is, how to get a job doing it, and tips for beginning and aspiring devrels.

This was forked and reverse-engineered from https://github.com/Nutlope/whatisdevrel to show that its much cleaner to actually use markdown as source. The HTML file was fully generated in the build-step.
